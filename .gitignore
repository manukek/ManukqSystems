# Output of the go toolchain
#
# Compiled binaries, typically in the current directory or a `bin/` directory
# for larger projects.
#
# For example:
#   go build -o myprogram
#   go install myprogram
#
# This will create `myprogram` or `myprogram.exe` in the current directory
# or in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`.
#
# If you are using Go modules, the compiled binary will be in the current directory
# or a `bin/` directory within your project.
#
# Examples:
#   myprogram
#   myprogram.exe
#   bin/myprogram
#   bin/myprogram.exe
#
# You might need to adjust this based on your project's build process.
#
# Common output locations:
#   /bin/
#   /build/
#   /dist/
#
# If you place your binaries directly in the project root, you might need to
# explicitly ignore them. For example:
#   myprogram
#   myprogram.exe
#   main
#   main.exe

# Dependency directories (Go modules)
#
# If you are using Go modules, these directories are typically not committed.
#
# Example:
#   vendor/
#
# If you are not using modules, or if you explicitly want to commit vendor,
# you can remove or comment out this line.
vendor/
